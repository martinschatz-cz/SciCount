# Preliminary Results
Preliminary results for object detection using Semi-Supervised learning approach on blood cell detection with YOLOv5 model. 

The aim was to test fast approach for manualy labeled cropped data and creating anotation on whole images in first run of learning. The second run is made on cleared labeling for whole images. To manualy label everything is time consuming, and this abroach means that only about 5-15% of labels needs to be removed or corresced, which speeds up whole proces of labeling.
