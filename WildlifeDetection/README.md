## Cukor, J., Linda, R., Václavek, P., Mahlerová, K., Šatrán, P., Havránek, F. (2019) Confirmed cannibalism in wild boar and its possible role in African swine fever transmission. Transboundary and Emerging Diseases 67(3). https://doi.org/10.1111/tbed.13468
The first cases of African Swine Fever (ASF) have been detected in Kenya in 1910, and since 1957 the virus is spreading throughout Europe causing considerable socio-economic losses not only in the wild boar populations but also in domestic pigs. The mortality rate of ASF is up to 90 %, with cadavers being hidden potential source of infection in the wild. In the presented study the behavior of wild boars was documented by came traps and obtained videos were manually inspected, documenting several different behavioral patterns. The results show previously unrecorded cannibalism in wild boars, such a behavior can serve as a very effective way of infection transmission as ASF virus is present in high loads in all tissues and body fluids of an infected animal.
