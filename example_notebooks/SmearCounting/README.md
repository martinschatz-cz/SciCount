# info
The example notebooks shows how to use augmentation and YOLO_v5 for object detection in blood smears.

## Data
Used subset of data is taken from:
**[Chula-RBC-12 DatasetÂ is a dataset of red blood cell](https://github.com/Chula-PIC-Lab/Chula-RBC-12-Dataset)**
Chula-RBC-12 Dataset is a dataset of red blood cell (RBC) blood smear images used in "Red Blood Cell Segmentation with Overlapping Cell Separation and Classification from an Imbalanced Dataset", containing 12 classes of RBC types consisting of 706 smear images that contain over 20,000 RBC cells. The dataset was collected at the Oxidation in Red Cell Disorders Research Unit, Chulalongkorn University in 2019 using a DS-Fi2-L3 Nikon microscope at 1000x magnification.

Data set is in JPEG (unspecified loss compresion), with unspecified form of labeling, it contains text and graphics objects in 70% of images, but about 30% of images are usable for object counting training.
